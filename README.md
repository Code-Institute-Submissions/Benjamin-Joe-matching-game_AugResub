## Design
The color scheme is blue and purple. I feel it makes the game look and feel warm and inviting to play.<br>
On the back of each playing card is a photo of dog bones and a kennel. When the player hovers over the card it moves to make the user aware of where they are about to click.<br>
Upon clicking on a card there is a flip animation before the reveal of the picture on the other side. This shows a clear difference between the two card sides.
<br>
Upon finishing the game the user will recieve a finished game screen depending of their results. If the user wins, they recieve a Winner message. If the user loses, they receive a game over message. Both messages are equipped with a press to play again function.

## What is Pair A Pup?
<br>Pair A Pup is a pet project of mine. ;)<br> 
It is a game made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The aim of the game is simple, pair up the pooches before the clock hits 0!
There are 8 pups to match up and an 80 second timer to put the user under some pressure.
There is also a flip counter to show the user how well the user is doing!
There is one other section for this website, a contact page.
The contact page is a way to send feedback or any issues directly to me so that I can 
make sure everything is living up to the user's expectations, and if the user has any issues then they can contact me directly

## Sources
I had a lot of help building this game, and a lot of sources have been used in order to get the game operational.
Here is a list of websites that were used in the making of this game:

* [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/)
* [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)

## Issues
I came across several issues along the way. Most of them
I was eventually able to solve.
Issues I was able to solve:
* Countdown timer not working
* Countdown timer counting below zero
* Winner message not showing upon a win

There were also some issues I was not able to solve regrettably. They are as follows:
* Issues with timer speeding up after a game over reset
* Sometimes double clicking a card will display match animation even without having found the match.
