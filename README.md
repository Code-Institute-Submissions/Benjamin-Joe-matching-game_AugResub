# **Pair A Pup Game **

## What is Pair A Pup?
<br>Pair A Pup is a pet project of mine. ;)<br> 
It is a game made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The aim of the game is simple, pair up the pooches before the clock hits 0!
There are 8 pups to match up, a 60 second timer to put some pressure on you
and a flip counter to show you how well you are doing!
There are two other sections fo this website. A rules/funfact page and a contact page.
The rules of the game are self explanitory, but there is a rule list just in case.
The contact page is a way to send feedback or any issues directly to me so that I can 
make sure everything is living up to user's expectations.
